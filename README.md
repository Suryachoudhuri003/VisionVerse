<h1 align="center">Real Time Object Detection Web App with Audio Assistance : **VisionVerse** </h1>
The project **VisionVerse** is a web-based application that utilizes real-time object detection to identify and label objects within an image or video stream and give out the recognised object as audio output. It is built using Next.js, ONNXRuntime, and YOLOv7 model.

## :innocent::thought_balloon: Motivation
This research details the development of a Real-Time Object Detection system designed toenhance the spatial awareness of visually impaired individuals. 
- This Real-Time Object Detection system represents a significant step towards fosteringinclusivity for the visually impaired, providing a tangible solution to the challenges they facein their daily lives. By harnessing the power of modern technology, this project seeks tobridge the gap between the visually impaired and their environment, ultimately enhancingtheir autonomy and facilitating a more inclusive and accessible society.
- The primary objective is to empower the blind with the ability to perceive and navigate their surroundings moreeffectively. The proposed solution employs advanced computer vision techniques to detectand recognize objects in real time, subsequently relaying this information through an intuitiveaudio output interface.

## :computer: Working :abacus:
- The system utilizes a deep learning framework for object detection, allowing it to identify adiverse range of objects in the user's environment.
- A camera captures live visual data, whichis then processed in real time by the trained neural network.
- The identified objects aretranslated into meaningful auditory cues, providing the user with immediate and actionableinformation about their surroundings.
- This auditory feedback is crucial for enabling aseamless integration of the system into the user's daily life, promoting independent mobility,and fostering a sense of confidence and security.

## :dizzy: Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### :key: Prerequisites
In order to run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- A web browser 

### ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/juanjaho/real-time-object-detection-web-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd real-time-object-detection-web-app
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
```
npm install
# or 
yarn install
```

4. Start the development server by running:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

### :nerd_face: Installation as PWA

This app can also be installed on your device (desktop or mobile) as a progressive web app (PWA). Here's how:

1. Visit the app's URL in a web browser that supports PWAs (such as Google Chrome or Firefox).
2. Look for the "Install" or "Add to Homescreen" button in the browser's interface. 
3. Click the button and follow the prompts to install the app.
4. The app will now be installed on your device and can be launched from the homescreen like any other app.
